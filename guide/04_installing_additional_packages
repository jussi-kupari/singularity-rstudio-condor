## Installing Additional Packages
## Interactive session

# Starting in the project directory
./run_r.sh

# In R:

# The installing should default to R_libs
install.packages("additional_package", lib="/project/R_libs")
BiocManager::install("Bioconductor_package", lib="/project/R_libs")

# Works the same in RStudio
